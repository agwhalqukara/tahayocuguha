He composed several songs for the group—including Top 10 hits “You’re My Best Friend”, “Another One Bites the Dust”, and “I Want to Break Free”; co-wrote “Under Pressure”, “Friends Will Be Friends” and “One Vision”—and was involved in the band’s financial management.</p><p>Deacon joined his first band, The Opposition, in 1965 at the age of 14. The band played covers of chart hits; Deacon played rhythm guitar using an instrument he had bought with money borrowed from the group’s founder, Richard Young. He switched to bass the following year after the original bassist was fired for not improving his playing as much as the other members. As well as a dedicated musician, Deacon also was the band’s archivist, taking clippings from newspapers of even the advertisements featuring The Opposition. After being in the band for four years, not long after the group cut an acetate of three songs, Deacon played his final concert with the band (then called The Art) in August 1969. He left as he had been accepted to study at Chelsea College in London (now part of King’s College London), where he obtained a First Class Honours degree in Electronics in 1971. Having become a fan of Deep Purple, he saw the group perform the Concerto for Group and Orchestra with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall that September.</p><p align=justify>He was married to Veronica Tetzlaff on January 18 1975. They had six children as a couple.&nbsp;He left the music industry in 1997.</p><p align=justify>He was the very last and youngest member of Queen.&nbsp;He wrote at least one song for each album for the legendary band.</p><p align=justify>John Richard Deacon was born on 19 August 1951 in Leicester to Arthur Henry and Lilian Molly Deacon (née Perkins). His father worked at the Norwich Union insurance company and in 1960 the family moved to the dormitory town of Oadby. Deacon was known to friends and his bandmates as ‘Deaks’ or ‘Deaky’ and attended Linden Junior School in Leicester, Gartree High School and Beauchamp Grammar School in Oadby. He became interested in electronics, reading magazines on the subject and building small devices, including the modification of a reel-to-reel tape deck to record music directly from the radio. He studied well and achieved 8 GCE O level and 3 A level passes, all at grade A. He particularly enjoyed soul music.</p><h2>John Deacon Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John is one of the <strong>richest Bassist</strong> from United Kingdom.

He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen’s career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar, keyboards and piano on Queen’s studio work.</p><p>In 1973, Rolling Stone wrote that the combination of Taylor and Deacon “is explosive, a colossal sonic volcano whose eruption makes the earth tremble.” Deacon played guitar in addition to bass, taking over rhythm parts on many albums, as well as several acoustic performances. Some of the guitar work on Hot Space (the clean Fender Telecaster single-coil sound) is Deacon’s. He would occasionally play synthesizers on his own compositions and often composed at the piano, playing a Wurlitzer electric piano on “You’re My Best Friend”. He can also be seen playing the grand piano in the music video to “Spread Your Wings”, although on the actual recording the piano was played by Mercury. Unlike the other three members of Queen, Deacon did not sing on the group’s records, though he did occasionally sing backing vocals during live performances.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John Deacon ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen’s bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon.

In 1970, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor had formed Queen; Deacon saw them in October that year but was not immediately impressed. Later in the year, he briefly formed a band called Deacon that made one live appearance at Chelsea College.</p><p align=justify>Deacon’s first writing credit came on Queen’s third album, Sheer Heart Attack (1974). He wrote “Misfire”, a Caribbean-themed song where he played almost all guitar parts, and co-wrote “Stone Cold Crazy” with the rest of the band. He also played some guide guitar parts on the album as May had been hospitalised with hepatitis when recording started. His second song was written for his wife-to-be Veronica, “You’re My Best Friend” (1975) was featured on the group’s fourth album, A Night at the Opera, and went on to be an international hit. Subsequently, Deacon tended to write one or two songs for every Queen album, until The Miracle (1989) and Innuendo (1991), which credited the band as a whole. He wrote the hit “Another One Bites The Dust” (1980) as a dance song based on his early love of soul. The song saw radio play on both black and white US music stations. He began to collaborate more with Mercury during the 1980s, as they both wanted to change the band’s musical direction.</p><h2>Top Facts about John Deacon</h2><li>John Deacon was the bassist for Queen.</li><li>He wrote some of their biggest hits, including “Another One Bites the Dust.”</li><li>Deacon was born on August 19, 1951 in Leicester, England.</li><li>He joined Queen in 1971 and played with them until 1997.</li><li>Deacon retired from music after Freddie Mercury’s death in 1991.</li><li>His net worth is estimated to be around $170 million.</li><li>Deacon has been married to Veronica Tetzlaff since 1975.</li><li>He has six children and currently lives a private life in London.</li><li>In addition to playing bass guitar, he also played rhythm guitar and keyboards on some tracks.</li><li>Deacon was known for his melodic bass lines and precise playing style.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>John Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Bassist</strong>.
