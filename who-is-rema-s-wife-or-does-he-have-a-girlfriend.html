Also, he had a romantic date with a lady named Nimmie.</strong></p><p>Rema has publicly aired his view about love and relationship through his music. Yet, this does not seem to be the exact case when it comes to the revelation of the women he has been with. Whatever the case, the&nbsp;Calm Down&nbsp;crooner has had some form of connection with women within and outside the music industry.</p><h2><strong>Who is Rema’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>From the information that is available, Rema does not have a girlfriend. However, around 2020, it was rumored that the singer was in a relationship with a lady named Niimie. Also, sometime in his career, there were rumors claiming that the singer may be married.</p><p>However, Nimmie claimed to not have been in any relationship with the Mavin Records signee. Instead, she was a fan whom he took out for a romantic date and other hangouts.</p><p>Also, it turned out that the news suggesting that he could be married was false.</p><p>As far as we know, Rema has not publicly opened up about dating anyone. and in 2020,&nbsp; he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>cried out about his needing</a> a wife.

Also, several suggestions came up.</p><h2><b>Is Rema Married?&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Rema is not married and has claimed to be <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">afraid</a> of going into a relationship. According to him, a lot of women would want to be with him because of fantasy and not for who he is. As such, it will be difficult for these women to stick around when there is trouble or when he is going through challenges.</p><p>He further made it known that sometimes, he feels as though people like him were not meant to be married.</p><p>Going deeper into the conversation, the singer revealed that the internet is scary and there are just too many red flags. To him, relationships become too complicated even before you go into them.
