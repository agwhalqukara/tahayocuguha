Unfortunately, some sellers take advantage of this demand and engage in fraudulent activities. This section will highlight some of the common ways to identify king crab scams.</p><h3><span id=Misleading_Labels>Misleading Labels</span></h3><p>One way scammers deceive buyers is by using misleading labels. For example, a seller may label their product as “Alaskan King Crab” when it is not actually from Alaska. Some may also use the term “wild-caught” to imply that the crab is caught in the wild, when in reality, it may be farmed. Therefore, it is important to verify the authenticity of the labels before making a purchase.</p><h3><span id=Price_Inflation>Price Inflation</span></h3><p>Another way scammers operate is by inflating the price of the king crab. They may offer the product at a much higher price than its actual value, making it seem like a premium product. Buyers should be cautious when they encounter such offers and do their research before making a purchase.</p><h3><span id=Quality_Deception>Quality Deception</span></h3><p>Scammers may also deceive buyers by selling low-quality king crab. They may use clever marketing tactics to make their product appear fresh and of high quality when it is not. Buyers should be wary of sellers who offer deals that seem too good to be true.</p><p>In conclusion, buyers should be vigilant when purchasing king crab and watch out for misleading labels, price inflation, and quality deception. By doing research and verifying the authenticity of the product, buyers can avoid falling victim to king crab scams.</p><h2><span id=Victims_of_King_Crab_Scam>Victims of King Crab Scam</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, many people have fallen victim to the King Crab scam. Scammers running these websites use a variety of unethical marketing tactics to attract their prey. They entice and ensnare victims by bidding on keywords like “King Crab legs” and “Alaskan Crab” to allow scam ads to appear prominently in search results. They also use social media to promote their fake sites.</p><p>One such website is TopKingCrab.com. This fraudulent site posts enticing photos of seafood like King Crab legs and Maryland Crabs offered at absurdly low prices. After victims place orders and submit payment online, no products are ever shipped. The photos, reviews, company information, and listed staff are all fictitious, and the website is a complete scam.</p><p>Another victim of the King Crab scam reported that a company called Top King Crab in China listed a special of 6 pounds of King crab for $29.99 which her husband fell for. It included free shipping and a delivery date, but the package never arrived.</p><p>It is important to be aware of these scams and to do thorough research before making any online purchases. Always check the legitimacy of the website and read reviews from other customers before making any payments. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p><h2><span id=How_to_Avoid_King_Crab_Scam>How to Avoid King Crab Scam</span></h2><p>To avoid falling victim to King Crab scams, there are a few things to keep in mind.
