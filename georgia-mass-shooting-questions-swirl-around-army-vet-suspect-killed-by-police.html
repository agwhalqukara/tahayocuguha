allegedly <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>gunned down four</a> of his neighbors in 10 minutes in his Georgia subdivision Saturday left a string of unanswered questions for investigators to unravel after he was killed in a gunfight with law enforcement officers, authorities said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The 41-year-old suspect, Andre Longmore, died Sunday afternoon when officers cornered him in Jonesboro, Georgia, about 20 miles from where he allegedly committed the crimes, according to officials.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The monster is dead," Henry County Sheriff Reginald Scandrett said while announcing Longmore's death Sunday evening.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A massive manhunt for Longmore ended when officers spotted him at an intersection in Jonesboro and engaged him in a gunfight, Scandrett said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d8ba7d45-27af-4d5b-bbb4-546994239c7a/hampton-georgia-shooting-suspect-ht-jt-230715_1689454687172_hpEmbed_16x9.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The suspect returned fire and hit the ground running," Scandrett said. "We gave chase, reengaged the suspect. He produced a handgun again. Gunfire was exchanged. The suspect was neutralized," Scandrett said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Two officers, who were part of the manhunt for Longmore, were injured by gunfire during the shootout and hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. One, according to Scandrett, was shot in the back.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Additional information about the fatal gunfight was not disclosed.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Scandrett said the case remains under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.</p><h2 class="RxNC PvZ nIjP PMXY LmsH SfAH mNgy lNbo LBPR">What was the motive and why did the suspect allegedly target neighbors?</h2><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Chief among the answers investigators are searching for is why Longmore allegedly targeted his neighbors in the Dogwood Lakes subdivision in Hampton, a city that, before Saturday morning, had not had a homicide since 2018.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"That's still being investigated," Chief James Turner said at Sunday's news conference.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Turner said the shooting rampage in the Dogwood Lakes subdivision unfolded around 10:45 a.m. on Saturday and that Longmore fatally shot four of his neighbors in 10 minutes, leaving bodies behind at different locations, all within proximity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/187f507e-2a64-4219-b017-7bdff97f7cee/georgia-1-abc-er-230716_1689513722046_hpMain_16x9.jpg><h2 class="RxNC PvZ nIjP PMXY LmsH SfAH mNgy lNbo LBPR">Who are the victims of the mass shooting?</h2><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Killed in the mass shooting were Scott Leavitt, 67, and his wife, Shirley Leavitt, 66, Turner said. Also killed were Steve Blizzard, 65, and Ronald Jeffers, 66, Turner said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Rev. John Anderson of the Pinecrest Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia, released a statement identifying Jeffers as a member of his congregation.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Unfortunately, one of the good men at the Pinecrest was the first victim of this deranged act of violence," said Anderson, adding that Jeffers leaves behind and wife and a daughter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Scott Leavitt Jr., the son of Scott and Shirley Leavitt, recalled the love his parents shared for each other.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"They always said neither one of them would be able to live without the other, so we’ve been able to find some comfort that they went together," the son <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>told The Associated Press</a> at a candlelight vigil for the victims attended by several hundred community residents in Hampton Monday night.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Victim Steve Blizzard loved photography and adventure, his brother, Harold Blizzard, told the AP at Monday night's vigil. The two brothers had planned to take a road trip along Route 66 in early July, but Harold Blizzard said he had to cancel due to a medical issue.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“It’s the biggest regret of my life,” Harold Blizzard said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0a88c470-4779-464b-8b9c-7c8f9506a3b7/atlanta-active-shooter-ht-jt-230715_1689447985216_hpMain_16x9.jpg><h2 class="RxNC PvZ nIjP PMXY LmsH SfAH mNgy lNbo LBPR">Did the suspect's mental history play a role in the mass shooting?</h2><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Longmore's mother, Dennis, said her son suffered a mental breakdown in 2014 and has never been the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8effcb0b-50bf-4faa-8515-9be57deeb458/georgia-2-ht-er-230716_1689514001313_hpEmbed_7x5.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Dennis said her son once worked as a master mechanic and a surgical instrument technician. She also said her son was an Army veteran.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"He just kept deteriorating until now," Dennis said. "I tried to get some help for him, but they kept saying that he has to commit a crime, or, you know, like, break up the house or anything, try to hurt himself. But if he wasn't doing that, he has to come in voluntarily to get medical attention, but he said he doesn't need it and doesn't want it."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">U.S. Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee confirmed to ABC News on Monday that Longmore served in the Army between August 2000 and May 2006 and held the rank of sergeant. Dubee said Longmire was also an automated logistical specialist.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">During his time in the military, Longmore received several medals, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and a Combat Action Badge, said Dubee, adding that information on Longmore's deployments was not immediately available.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Dennis said she is heartbroken for the families of the victims her son is accused of killing.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It’s hard to lose your son, and it’s also hard to know your son cost the life of so many people,” Dennis said. “I think about the families even more than I think about my son.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmienqeinLaiecyaqqxlo528sMDIp55mqaWawLW1zqeqZqunnr%2BtedKuqqmdk6l6rLXLpZydZZequ6e1xqGraKukpL%2B6i8iddGpoYWiBdoCXcg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jane-fonda-83-reveals-she-wants-men-to-say-she-looks-good-for-her-age.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jane Fonda, 83, reveals she wants men 'to say she looks good for her age'</a>
