appearances in commercials (for Oreos and Standard Bank) and in the TV series House of Zwide, where she played the role of Keletso.</strong></p><p>Being a teenage actress, Karabo Magongwa’s mother keeps a better part of her daughter’s private life away from the public for reasons best known to her and probably for her daughter’s safety. However, we have gathered interesting facts about the real-life Keletso from House of Zwide: Karabo Magongwa.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Karabo Magongwa’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Karabo Magongwa</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Year of Birth:</strong> 2008</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Black</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> South African</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Her roles in South African commercials and drama series</li><li><strong>Karabo Magongwa’s Instagram:</strong> @karabo_magongwa</li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Karabo Magongwa</li></ul><h2><strong>The Exact Birthdate of Karabo Magongwa Remains a Mystery</strong></h2><p>The date of birth of Karabo Magongwa is unknown, but she was born in 2008 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Her mother is Patricia Magongwa, but there is no information regarding the identity of her father. There is also no information that would help ascertain if she had siblings or the kind of family she was born into.</p><p>Available reports show that she was raised by her mother, as there are no records about her father or any father figure in her life to date. The dearth of information about the actress may be down to the fact that she is only a teenager, and it is believed that as she grows and her influence in the industry expands, she may grant more interviews and reveal more details about her early life and childhood.</p><h2><strong>What Schools Did Karabo Magongwa Attend?</strong></h2><p>Karabo Magongwa was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and reports show that she grew up and made most of her childhood memories there.

According to available reports, Karabo had her elementary education at the Johannesburg Institutional Primary School, where she did her grade R school.</p><p>For high school, it is still difficult to tell which high school she attended because she and her family have not yet disclosed such details to the public, nor has she made any posts on her social media accounts as regards the high school she attends. However, you can rest assured that when that part of her life is clarified, we will bring it all to you on this channel.</p><p>At her current age – as of the time of this article – she should be in high school, so there may be no need to talk about the tertiary institution she must have attended as she is yet to attend any.</p><h2><strong>Karabo Magongwa Has Starred In A Couple of TV Series&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As early as three, Karabo expressed her desire to be on the television screen to her mother.

Three years later, she made her debut in acting as she starred in a commercial for Oreos biscuits – at the time, Karabo Magongwa was just six years old.</p><p>In this television commercial, Karabo explained to her on-screen father the need to eat biscuits. The television commercial later went on to be voted “The Cutest Kid Advert Ever” by Buzzfeed.com, a US online site with about 60 million users.</p><p>She has also starred in commercials for banks, including on for Standard Bank app for android and tablets.

Her character, Keletso, is an intelligent grade 7 pupil who her friends bullied for being a snitch, but she is able to stand up for herself.</p><p>The most beautiful thing about working on a movie production set is the interaction with an older and more experienced actor whom you could be inspired by and learn from as an upcoming actor. Having said that, working on the House of Zwide, Karabo has had the rare privilege to speak to and probably interact with some of the industry’s top stars, including legends like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Vusi Kunene</a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Winnie Ntshaba</a>.</p><h4><strong>A List of Karabo Magongwa’s Movies and TV Shows</strong></h4><p>Karabo Magongwa is believed to be one of the “Next Gen” stars in the South African film industry in years to come.
