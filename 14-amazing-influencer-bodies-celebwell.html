"I'm taking a break from [social media] to get myself out of the matrix of it all, so I can Ô¨Ågure out how I want to use it. It's hard to come up with a unique approach to posting when you're on it all the time and you're seeing what other people are doing because you end up subconsciously copying what everyone else is doing. Whereas if you're taking a break and you're stepping back for a while, you can start thinking outside of the box.

"</span><span>I don't talk much about my rock climbing endeavors and there's a reason for it. Simply put, I'm not that good and it's something that still terrifies me but I love doing it anyway. My friends are usually the ones putting up routes and I'll follow up behind them cleaning their gear. The more I do it, the more fun it becomes and, in 2019, I made some fulfilling strides in the sport."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKq6xaWsnqaTmr9urs6doJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./red-buttons-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>&#171;&nbsp;Red Buttons Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
