Since then, she has maintained a high profile in the Nigerian entertainment industry, playing characters in Arewà (2003), Òréjomí (2005), and Enu Mi (2020) among others. She has also gained several accolades for her contributions.</p><h2><strong>Profile Summary of Mide Martins</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Olumide ‘Mide’ Funmi Martins Abiodun</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 12 April 1979</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 44 Years Old</li><li><b>Occupation:&nbsp;</b>actress, producer, brand ambassador</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Providence Heights Secondary School Fagba, Lagos and Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye (Diploma International Relations)</li><li><strong>Active since: </strong>2001</li><li><strong>Spouse: </strong>Afeez Owo Abiodun</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> 2</li></ul><h2><strong>The 44-Year-Old Actress</strong><strong> Started Her Acting Journey At The Age of 22</strong></h2><p>On the 12th of April 1979 in Lagos, the Yoruba actress Mide Martins was born to iconic model and actress mother Funmi Martins, who died from a heart attack in 2002. Mide is believed to be from Lagos State or Oyo State. However, her mother is believed to be from Abeokuta, Ogun State, and Mide may be from the same State. The actress’s father is not known to the public at the time of this writing.</p><p>Martins started to see the insight of movies at age 14 in 1993 when her mother, Funmi Martins, began her acting career. Growing up with the actress, Mide also nurtured her love for the profession but didn’t venture into it until 2001, when she made an appearance in the movie Makan Je. However, it was in 2002, after her mother passed away, that she became more recognized.</p><p>Her career took its most important turn in 2003, a year after her mother’s passing, when she appeared in another Yoruba Language film Aréwa alongside Funso Adeolu, Kareem Adepoju, and Bukky Amos, to mention a few. At the age of 26 in 2005, Mide featured in Òréjomí. She further made appearances in Ayewo (2017), Girls at War (2020), and Late Date (2021). The 44-year-old actress continues to journey in her career as a film actress who does not seem ready to take a break any time soon.</p><h2><strong>She Attended The Same School With Zainab Ahmed And Toyin Abraham</strong></h2><p>The celebrated producer and actress attended the prestigious Olabisi Onabanjo University at Ago-Iwoye in Ogun State, where she obtained a diploma in International Relations. The school has also produced many notable people, including Zainab Ahmed, Ibrahim Bio, and Yetunde Onanuga. In addition, some well-known Nigerian celebrities like <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Toyin Abraham</a>, Lateef Adedimeji, Kehinde Bankole, Kaffy, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ronke Odusanya</a>, and Weird MC, among others, are graduates of the university.</p><p>Before she attended the University, Mide attended Community Grammar School Ibadan for her elementary education. She then proceeded to Providence Heights Secondary School for her high school education. Although it is unknown if the actress had an interest in acting while in school, education has definitely added to her skills directly or indirectly.</p><h2><strong>A Look At Her Career As Movie Producer and Brand Ambassador</strong></h2><p>When Mide Martins turned 24 in 2003, she opened herself to another side of the movie industry – production! She produced the movie Erù Elérù through the Flem Film Productions company.&nbsp; Under the same company in 2004, when she was 25 years old, she produced another film titled Omo Oku Òrun. However, Mide does not do much production in the movie industry.</p><p>Apart from her career in the movie industry, Mide is also a brand ambassador and influencer for products, including Osedudu Special Skincare and Shaddash Collections.</p><h2><strong>Awards and Nominations of Mide Martins</strong></h2><ul><li>Yoruba Movie Gist Awards (YMGA)- Best Supporting Actress (2020)</li><li>City People Movie Award- Best Actress of the Year (Yoruba) (2019)</li><li>City People Movie Award- Nomination Best Supporting Actress (Yoruba) (2017)</li><li>Posthumous Episcopal Award in honor of her mother from the Cathedral Church of St. Mathew (2016)</li></ul><h2><strong>She Found Her Husband in The Career She Chose</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/203517711_361339228889050_41111459480563282_n-e1624812416741.jpg><p>When Mide’s mother Funmi was still alive, Afeez Owo Abiodun was her manager. Upon the death of her mother, the actress became close to Afeez, who would later become her husband of many years and produce three children together – 2 daughters – Omotolani, Anuoluwapo, and a son. Afeez began his career as a film producer in 2000, a year before Mide made her acting career debut. He has maintained a good level of success as much as Mide.</p><p>Some of his produced films are Adurotulowa (2001), Abusi Edumare (2002), Oba bi Olorun (2006), Ipinu Mi (2016), and Obinrin Asiko (2021). Afeez is also a director and an actor who played roles in Egan, Ishipaya, and Oloto Ati Baba.&nbsp;Although their marriage made heads turn in the movie industry, it later became one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>failed marriages in Nollywood. </a>According to reports, the marriage crashed because Mide allegedly had an affair with NURTW Boss MC Oluomo and another businessman named Taiwo Kadri.</p><p>In 2016, after Mide’s separation from Afeez, their relationship took a different turn when Mide gave a clue on their return on social media. Those in the know claimed that her husband gave her an ultimatum to stay away from <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mercy Aigbe</a>, who allegedly influenced her negatively. As a result, Mide stopped modeling for Mercy’s clothing line, Magdivas.</p><h2><strong>The Success Of Mide Martins Also Comes With Some Controversies in Her Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Few months before Mide Martins’ mother died, the Veteran actress bore an alleged love child for Shina Peters, the Juju music legend. This son, known as Damilare Peters, was at the center stage earlier in 2021 following allegations of abandonment made against his father Shina Peters and older sister Mide Martins. Both Shina Peters and Mide Martins have continued to inform the public via their social media handles and an interview that several reasons surround the custody and responsibilities related to Damilare Peters.</p><p>Mide also <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>stated</a> that she attempted to gain custody of her brother and was denied on several occasions. Damilare grew up with his grandmother at Abeokuta until after her death, and he moved in with his uncle’s family. He recently took to social media appealing for financial assistance, which led to the unscrambling of all the following controversies. Following her own side of the story, Damilare concluded that he was not interested in changing homes now, especially going to live with anyone who has abandoned him for years. He then showed gratitude to all who have supported him with funds to further his education, as that’s his current priority.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57zKKbnmWdlr%2B1tc2sZJuhn5y%2ForzHsmSappRirqixjJqanKedpbmqv8emnKeso2KutHnAZrCoqqWXrm6twq2pnqujZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./natalie-nunn-on-nursing-breastfeeding-is-not-easy-at-all.html>&#171;&nbsp;NATALIE NUNN ON NURSING: BREASTFEEDING IS NOT EASY AT ALL</a>
