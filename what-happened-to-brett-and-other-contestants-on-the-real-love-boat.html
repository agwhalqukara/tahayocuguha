He appeared on the show during its first episode and got many fans talking about him. However, he departed the show during its second episode due to illness, leaving fans disappointed.</strong></p><p>Brett, a musician, never returned to the show, leaving fans wondering what happened to him. The exact nature of the illness that took Brett off the screens has not been revealed, but his disappearance from The Real Love Boat show has gotten many fans of the show completely annoyed, with some vowing to stop watching.</p><p>For the record, The Real Love Boat is a reality TV show that is designed to follow a group of love-seekers seeking romantic attachment and love on a luxury boat. The contestants are made to perform a number of tasks, and people are eliminated until the finalists and eventually the winners emerge. Brett was on the show for only one episode before suddenly departing.</p><h2><strong>Why Brett DeLaura was Popular On </strong><strong>Real Love Boat</strong></h2><p>Brett DeLaura became one of the most popular names on The Real Love Boat right from his appearance in its first episode. One of the reasons for this is that Brett, who hails from Dana Point, California, is a very talented musician who has already gained quite a recognition for his captivating charisma, striking good looks, and musical artistry. When he appeared on the show, some fans recognized him, and his combination of charm and musical talent made him a standout.</p><p>Brett DeLaura is not just a solo artist; he is also a key member of Holiday State, a country music group that he co-founded with his brothers, Brandon and Bryan, in 2014. The DeLaura brothers are exceptionally versatile, having honed their musical skills over an extended period. As they expressed to Voyage LA, they are involved in every aspect of their music, from singing and songwriting to playing instruments, producing, and performing their original compositions. They take pride in their continuously evolving music and the meaningful connections they have built along their journey.</p><p>Throughout their careers, the DeLaura brothers have graced numerous venues across Southern California, including a memorable high school and college tour in 2016. In 2017, they served as the supporting act for a national tour and even opened for the multi-platinum recording artist O-Town.&nbsp;In 2017, Brett and his brothers were not only esteemed guest judges but also featured performers at the Music Changing Lives showcase in Riverside, California. In 2018, they journeyed to Nashville to collaborate with producer Andy Sheridan, known for his work with artists such as Hunter Hayes and Ben Rector.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Brett-De1.jpg><p>They have also recorded with producer Tyler Cain, who has worked with big names like Big & Rich, Darius Rucker, and Billy Currington. Their musical journey took a significant step with the release of their debut single, “Friday Feelin,” in 2019. The single received acclaim and was featured on Spotify’s New Music Nashville playlist, as well as gaining attention from influential music blogs. Subsequent singles like “Not Today,” “Where I Wanna Be,” “Steal the Thunder,” and “Sun Up Sun Down” also received high praise from their growing fanbase.</p><p>It was following their success in the music industry that Brett DeLaura decided to embark on a new adventure by joining The Real Love Boat in search of a special someone with whom he could share the rest of his life.</p><h2><strong>What was Real Love Boat Brett’s Illness?</strong></h2><p>When the inaugural episode of The Real Love Boat graced the screens in 2022, one standout figure in the cast was immediately evident – Brett DeLaura. He captivated the audience not just because of his striking charisma but also because of his eloquence and the added allure of being a member of the country-pop trio Holiday State. His presence made a significant impact on the show and instantly drew the attention of viewers.</p><p>Brett’s charismatic presence on The Real Love Boat resonated with many viewers, and many were undoubtedly hoping he would be a long-term fixture on the show, eager to see how his journey would unfold. However, to the dismay of his ardent fans, he made an unexpected departure during the second episode of the show, leaving many puzzled. The show’s official explanation cited an unspecified illness as the reason behind his exit, though they provided little detail about the nature of this ailment.</p><p>It has since been confirmed that Brett’s departure from the show indeed stemmed from an illness. Nevertheless, the precise nature of this ailment remains shrouded in mystery, leaving fans curious and concerned. The lack of information about his condition has led to speculation and questions from fans, who are eager to know more about what prompted his sudden departure. Some have put out a list of illnesses that Brett could be suffering from, but none of these have been confirmed to be correct.</p><p>Interestingly, Brett himself has not yet addressed his abrupt departure on his social media channels, adding more intrigue to the whole saga. This silence from Brett has only fueled the curiosity of his followers, who are left in the dark about what led to his departure and how he’s fared since leaving the show. As expected, many viewers have openly expressed their disappointment, with some admitting that Brett was a significant reason for their viewership.</p><p>His presence had a substantial impact on the show, considering his fandom, and his departure left a void that fans struggled to fill. For a while, many eagerly awaited any updates from Brett, hoping for more information about his well-being and the reasons behind his exit. There is hope that one day, Brett may eventually shed light on the reasons for his exit through social media.</p><p>While Brett’s departure may have left a void on the show, The Real Love Boat continued to offer its fair share of drama every week. However, it’s worth noting that the show did not achieve the soaring ratings one might have expected, even with its prime slot right next to The Amazing Race on the schedule. Some have attributed it to Brett’s departure, while others claim it is because the show did not offer the excitement anticipated.</p><h2><strong>Who were The Real Love Boat Contestants?</strong></h2><p>The Real Love Boat reality show started with 12 contestants.

According to her, when they were on the cruise boat used for the show, they were essentially on vacation and had no responsibilities at all. Everything was meticulously arranged for all contestants, including all their romantic encounters and dates. However, once they returned to their everyday lives, they were jolted back to reality, realizing that real life was a far cry from what they experienced on the ship.</p><p>For instance, Kendra said she had a full-time job to manage, along with the responsibilities of taking care of her dog. Her daily life was incredibly busy, which posed a significant contrast to the carefree atmosphere of the cruise. Her lover, Jordan, also had his own challenges and had to navigate between working full-time and having time for her. Their responsibilities and commitments created a different set of demands, especially because they were not living in the same city. In the end, they realized they just had to break up.</p><p>Interestingly, Kendra also revealed that during her time on the show, her strongest bonds were forged not with a man but with her fellow female cast members, especially Shea-Lynn Noyes. In fact, Kendra described Shea-Lynn as her best friend, underscoring the deep connections that were established not only through romantic relationships but also through the camaraderie and friendships that were a significant part of The Real Love Boat experience.</p><h3><strong>Are Any of The Real Love Boat Couples Still Together?</strong></h3><p>No! Unfortunately, all the couples from The Real Love Boat are no longer together. Even the winners of the show, Emily Stone and her partner, Mike Dubreuil, have parted ways. The reasons why they all parted ways are not clear. However, it is certain that their various reason must vary from couple to couple.</p><p>Apparently, romantic relationships come with different kinds of challenges, and it is very unpredictable what can happen when one falls in love with a romantic partner, especially in the kind of setting that The Real Love Boat provided.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BstaLAjKGYqaiVo7KledOoZJuqlanBbq3NnWSorJiav26vzqernquklru1v4yopWasmJp6s7HApWSlp6aaeqO7wK1m</p></div><div id=links><a href=./16-celebrities-you-never-imagined-were-south-africans.html>&#171;&nbsp;16 Celebrities You Never Imagined Were South Africans</a>
